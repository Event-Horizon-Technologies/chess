## Development Setup

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses `pre-commit` to ensure code quality and consistency. Before you can commit, you'll need to set up the necessary hooks:

1. Install `pre-commit`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install pre-commit

2. Install the pre-commit from our project into your local hooks. From the root of the project, do:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
